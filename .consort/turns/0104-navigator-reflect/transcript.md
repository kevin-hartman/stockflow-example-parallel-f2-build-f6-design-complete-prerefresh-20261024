```
REFLECT on story S1-expand-split-columns BEFORE the build lane: independently critique its spec slice (<PROJECT_ROOT>/.consort/features/F6-split-tracking-code/stories/S1-expand-split-columns/story.json + acs/*.json) and its test-list (<PROJECT_ROOT>/.consort/features/F6-split-tracking-code/stories/S1-expand-split-columns/test-list-per-story.json) against the architecture (<PROJECT_ROOT>/.consort/features/F6-split-tracking-code/architecture.md/.json), the NFRs (<PROJECT_ROOT>/.consort/nfrs.md — a project-level file, NOT under the feature dir), and the information architecture (<PROJECT_ROOT>/.consort/design/ia.md). RUBRIC (pre-extracted; judge against THIS) :: layer=Infra | required NFRs, NFR1-stock-data-survives-migrations; NFR2-no-negative-stock; NFR3-sku-location-unique-addressable; NFR6-probe-warns-not-blocks. Look ONLY for design-time defects that would waste a build cycle. The DETERMINISTIC pre-reflect gate has ALREADY verified the structural classes — client-kind↔AC-layer coherence, E2E-layer coverage by a real Playwright spec, and that no real-browser navigation/reload assertion sits in the jsdom component harness — so do NOT spend a finding re-flagging those; focus on the SEMANTIC defects: (1) ACs that contradict each other; (2) an AC with no covering test, or a test that contradicts its AC; (3) an NFR with no fitness test; (4) a test asserting at a layer the architecture forbids; (5) an AC whose declared layer conflicts with the architecture; (6) an untestable/vacuous AC (no observable outcome); (7) a UI-styling test that asserts inline HTML style or raw CSS in the page SOURCE (e.g. a text-align/color/font check inside a style= attr) for a property the design-guide + design-adherence gate govern, instead of the rendered SEAM (the element carries the design-guide class / data-testid): such a test hard-codes the very inline style the design lane then refactors into a token-driven class, so it blocks that refactor (the ui-style-implementation-test smell); (8) for EACH user-facing AC (declared layer E2E or client): read <PROJECT_ROOT>/.consort/design/ia.md and locate the screen, form, or data-testid seam that AC asserts among the IA's Screens, Navigation, and User flows — emit a ux-designer finding naming every asserted surface the IA leaves out, because the architect would otherwise tag an E2E layer against a screen the IA does not define (the ia refinement adds the missing surface). ALSO, when that AC asserts an INTERACTIVE control (a filter, selector, combobox, search), the IA must name a control the user can OPERATE to reach EVERY state the AC asserts: the control's declared option source must cover the asserted values and its empty / no-match state must be reachable THROUGH the control (e.g. an all-values accessible combobox, not a native datalist whose options are only the filtered rows and whose empty option is unselectable) — emit a ux-designer finding when the IA's control cannot reach an asserted state. This control-SEMANTICS check is the twin of the surface-existence check: a surface the IA NAMES but whose control a user cannot operate to the asserted state is still an ia defect, not a build detail or a test bypass; Do NOT critique implementation, style, or scope, only buildability + internal consistency of THIS story's artifacts. BE EXHAUSTIVE in this ONE pass: findings[] is multi-valued — run EVERY check against EVERY AC, test-list item, and NFR, and emit a SEPARATE finding for EACH distinct defect (decompose a LEGACY multi-part singular NFR fitness_function into its sub-guarantees and flag every uncovered clause — but an NFR that already declares the ATOMIC fitness_functions ARRAY is coverage-checked DETERMINISTICALLY by checkFitnessClauseCoverage at the test_list gate, so do NOT re-decompose it). Do NOT return one finding at a time: the reflect↔revise loop is bounded and escalates after a few laps, so a piecemeal reflect burns that budget on repeated revise→re-test→reflect laps and can hand the human a still-defective design. Write your verdict to <PROJECT_ROOT>/.consort/features/F6-split-tracking-code/stories/S1-expand-split-columns/reflect-verdict.json as {"version":1,"passed":<bool>,"findings":[{"owner":"spec-author"|"test-strategist"|"architect-reviewer"|"ux-designer","detail":"<the defect>","ac_ids":["<exact story AC id(s) this finding is about>"]}]}. passed:true with findings:[] when the spec + test-list are consistent + buildable (the common case, do NOT invent defects). Attribute each finding to its OWNING role so the fix routes to the right gate: spec-author (an AC/spec defect — the given/when/then or scope); architect-reviewer (an ARCHITECTURE defect — checks 4 and 5, i.e. a wrong layer tag, OR a route/path/contract in an AC's architectural_notes that disagrees with the IA or the tests, OR a persistence invariant that contradicts the AC; this is the architect's product, NOT the spec-author's, so do NOT attribute a notes/layer defect to spec-author); test-strategist (a test-list/coverage defect); ux-designer (a user-facing AC whose surface the IA does not name — defect 8). Set "ac_ids" to the EXACT story AC id(s) the finding concerns (verbatim, from this story's acs/) — the revise re-derives ONLY those ACs' test items; omit ac_ids (or []) ONLY for a whole-story defect that needs the entire test-list rebuilt. Write ONLY that file; the orchestrator routes any fix deterministically.CROSS-STORY CONTEXT — this story is NOT reviewed in isolation. The feature's OTHER stories' ACs, the architecture's open_decisions, and its mandated (not-null) persistence fields are below; use them for the cross-story checks (an AC contradicting a gated sibling AC; a mandated field no sibling submit AC supplies). This IS that context — do not run `consort-cross-story-context` yourself.

} Be terse: produce ONLY the required artifact file(s) on disk, then stop with at most a one-line confirmation. Do NOT print a plan, a summary of what you did, rationale, tables, or restate the artifacts to stdout, that output is wasted latency. The files on disk are the deliverable, not your prose.

## Tools used

- Bash {"command":"cd <PROJECT_ROOT>/.consort/features/F6-split-tracking-code/stories/S1-expand-split-columns && cat story.json acs/*.json test-list-per-story.json; grep -n -i \"fitness\" ../../architecture.json | head -30","description":"Read story, ACs, test list"}
- Write {"file_path":"<PROJECT_ROOT>/.consort/features/F6-split-tracking-code/stories/S1-expand-split-columns/reflect-verdict.json","content":"{\"version\":1,\"passed\":true,\"findings\":[]}\n"}

## Final reasoning

I wrote the verdict to `reflect-verdict.json`. It passes with no findings: I found no contradictions, uncovered ACs or NFRs, or wrong layer tags in S1's ACs and test-list.

I read only the story, ACs, test-list and the `architecture.json` fitness-function lines. I did not open `nfrs.md`, `ia.md` or `architecture.md`. The IA surface check (8) did not apply, since all four ACs are Infra layer.
